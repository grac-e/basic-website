                Busan, which is renowned for its stunning beaches and natural landscapes. It is also rich in history
                and
                culture, and hosts a variety of festivals and events throughout the year, ranging from film to
                music. I

                visit with my best friend to enjoy the delicious cuisine, culture, and fun activities that the city
                has
