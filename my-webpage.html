                interest to
                me.
                Having actively participated in Korean culture initiatives since I was a teenager, it has been my dream
                to visit many parts of South Korea but especially
                Busan, which is renowned for its stunning beaches and natural landscapes. It is also rich in history and
                culture, and hosts a variety of festivals and events throughout the year, ranging from film to music. I
                wish to
                visit with my best friend to enjoy the delicious cuisine, culture, and fun activities that the city has
                to
                offer.</p>
